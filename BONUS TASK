*AI-Powered Code Review Assistant: CodeCritique*

*Purpose:*
CodeCritique is an AI-powered code review tool designed to assist developers in improving code quality, security, and maintainability. It analyzes code repositories, identifies potential issues, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

*Workflow:*

1. *Integration*: CodeCritique integrates with popular version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. *Code Analysis*: AI-powered engines analyze code for:
    - Security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
    - Performance optimization opportunities
    - Code smells and refactoring suggestions
    - Compliance with coding standards and best practices
3. *Recommendation Generation*: CodeCritique provides actionable recommendations, including:
    - Code snippets and examples
    - Links to relevant documentation and resources
    - Automated code refactoring suggestions
4. *Developer Feedback*: Developers review and implement recommendations, with the option to provide feedback on the tool's suggestions.

*Impact:*

1. *Improved Code Quality*: CodeCritique helps developers identify and fix potential issues early, reducing technical debt and improving overall code quality.
2. *Increased Efficiency*: Automated code review saves time and effort, allowing developers to focus on high-priority tasks.
3. *Enhanced Security*: CodeCritique's security analysis helps identify vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.
4. *Knowledge Sharing*: CodeCritique's recommendations and code snippets facilitate knowledge sharing among developers, promoting best practices and coding standards.

*Technical Details:*
